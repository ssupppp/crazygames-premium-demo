## Design & Assets

### Visual Design
The demo must visually match CrazyGames' actual website design.

**Before building, analyze CrazyGames:**
1. Visit https://www.crazygames.com
2. Visit https://developer.crazygames.com
3. Extract and replicate:
   - Exact brand colors (hex values)
   - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, hierarchy)
   - Layout structure and spacing
   - Component styles (buttons, cards, navigation)
   - Logo and iconography
   - Game thumbnails and titles (use real games from their site)

**If screenshots are provided:**
- Use screenshots in `/reference-screenshots/` as primary reference
- Extract all design tokens from provided images
- Match visual design as closely as possible

### Asset Requirements
- Use actual CrazyGames logo
- Use real game thumbnails from their homepage
- Match their color palette exactly
- Replicate their UI component styling
- Mirror their layout patterns

## Core Concept
A toggle-able website showing Free vs Premium experiences:

1. **Free User Experience** - with ads, limited earning
2. **Premium User Experience** - ad-free, enhanced rewards, exclusive content
3. **Developer Dashboard** - opt-in flow, configuration, revenue tracking

Users can toggle between modes to see real-time differences.

## Pages Structure

### User-Facing (5 pages)
1. **Homepage** (`/`) - Games grid, ads (conditional), navigation
2. **Profile** (`/profile`) - User stats, badge, coin balance
3. **Game View** (`/game`) - In-game experience with conditional ads
4. **Shop** (`/shop`) - Items marketplace, premium exclusives
5. **Premium Page** (`/premium`) - Pricing tiers, conversion flow

### Developer-Facing (4 pages)
6. **Dashboard** (`/developer`) - Games overview, enable premium
7. **Enable Flow** (`/developer/enable`) - Revenue estimate, activation
8. **Configure** (`/developer/configure`) - Set benefits, create exclusive items
9. **Revenue** (`/developer/revenue`) - Analytics, earnings breakdown
